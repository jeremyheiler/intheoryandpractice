# Chapter 1: Introduction

The first chapter is rather short; it's only four pages. It introduces
parsing in terms of grammars, but avoids being too specific. The
specifics are the rest of the book! One interesting aspect of this is
that the authors refrain from letting the reader assume that parsing
is just about computer languages. 

> [Parsing is] for anybody who has parsing to do: the compiler writer,
the linguist, the database interface writer, the geologist or
musicologist who wants to test grammatical descriptions of their
respective objects of interest, and so on. *(pg. 1)*

Another thing the authors mention is that the book contains a complete
list of references. Most of the references are annotated with a short
description of the content which allows "the reader to decide if the
referred article is worth reading" *(pg. 3)*. The book lists only the
ones mentioned within, about 400, but the book's website has a
[complete list][0]. There are 1700 references in total, for which 1100
of them are annotated.
